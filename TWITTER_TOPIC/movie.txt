Here's my thoughts on each, and on whether #DisneyPlus is worth your money on day one.@lounarshua - i’m like a new movie, yeah bitch, i’m coming soon@mdbilal777 - RT @Thalapathy_FW: #Bigil is the highest grossing Tamil movie of the year 2019. #ThalapathyVIJAY 😎@RothsReviews - High School Musical: The Musical: The Series does a good job of pulling you in, even if you haven't seen the movie (like me!), but highlights both the biggest strength and fault of #DisneyPlus. It's easy to find/watch the movie; but the show almost feels like one big ad for it.@RothsReviews - TL;DR on #DisneyPlus: Lots of cross promotions, some Disneyfying, but still some generally fun and intriguing content available to watch — for less than the price of a movie ticket — while we wait for heavy hitters like Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, Monsters at Work, etc. to premiere.@_NiSong_five - RT @MCU_Direct: The third #AntMan movie is set to start filming in January 2021, according to actor Michael Douglas! https://t.co/CRHUpUPqF…@coolstorybro58 - RT @NinSEGAdo86: Dat Ms. Carolina's dance from Crayon Shin Chan movie 23.🙏🍑 #crayonshinchan https://t.co/XSTE1n0OeT@jenniferturcio3 - RT @goslngs: the way i would do anything to have all of them in a movie together https://t.co/7iMX9CgrQG@NitheeshVj - RT @BLSTG: Cant remember when was the last big movie that had breakeven in all neighbouring states as well as overseas.. #Bigil is doing th…@erintracycomedy - I’m about to watch a scary movie alone.
